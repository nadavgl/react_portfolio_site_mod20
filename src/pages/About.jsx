                    <p>Hi, I'm Nadav, a new  developer with a focus on backend development . Currently, I'm honing my skills in Node.js and Express, while working on exciting projects like blog platforms and social network APIs. When I'm not coding, you might find me biking 40 miles a day or watching basketball highlights. Welcome to my portfolio, where you can explore my work and see what I've been up to!</p>
